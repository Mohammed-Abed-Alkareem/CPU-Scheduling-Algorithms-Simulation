# CPU-Scheduling-Algorithms-Simulation
Simulation for CPU Scheduling Algorithms with plotting Gantt-Chart

# Summary

Creating a scheduling algorithm simulation project involves implementing various scheduling algorithms, generating Gantt charts, and calculating average waiting time and average turnaround time.

# Specifications
## Scheduling Algorithms:

- First-Come, First-Serve (FCFS)
- Shortest Job First (SJF)
- Priority Scheduling
- Round Robin (RR)
- Preemptive Priority Scheduling, with aging
- Non-preemptive Priority Scheduling, with aging

## Process Details:

- Arrival Time: The time at which a process arrives in the ready queue.
- Burst Time: The time required by a process for execution.
- Comes back after: The interval or time duration after which a process returns to the ready queue after completing execution.
- Priority: The priority assigned to a process, relevant for Priority Scheduling.
# Once each process is done processing its “Burst Time”, it goes to the waiting queue, then “Comes back” to the ready queue after the "Comes back after".
